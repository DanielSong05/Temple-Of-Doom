Temple of Doom
South Dakota Smith and the Temple of Doom is an action-adventure game inspired by the adventures of an archaeology professor who once stole ancient artifacts but now redeems himself by donating game profits to the descendants of the original creators. In this game, you explore a multi-level temple, battle monsters, pick up treasures, and ultimately search for the elusive golden idol.
